## About

Q-Tac-Toe leverages Q-learning, a popular RL algorithm, to train an AI agent capable of playing tic-tac-toe strategically. The agent learns the optimal moves to maximize its chances of winning or forcing a draw.

## Features

- Reinforcement Learning: Q-learning algorithm implementation.
- Human vs. AI: Challenge the trained AI agent in tic-tac-toe matches.
- Interactive Gameplay: Play the game in the terminal with user-friendly input.
- Learn and Improve: The AI agent continuously improves its gameplay strategy through training.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone [repository-url]

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install numpy
3. Run the game:
   ```bash
   python3 Q-Tac-Toe.py

## How to Play
You can play against the AI agent by choosing your moves during the game.

The AI agent will make its moves based on its learned strategy.

The game will continue until there is a winner, a draw, or you decide to quit.
